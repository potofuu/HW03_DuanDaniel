#### Instruction Manuel
This game involves you controlling a player, the green square, and shooting at multiple enemies. The controls required for this game are start, left, right, up, and down. 
The movement controls are mapped corresponding to their names, and the start button is used to begin the game at the start, and pause it throughout. The goal of the game is
to hit every enemy with your bullet, whilst avoiding contact with any enemies. If you are hit/touch an enemy, the game will end, leading you to a defeat screen. If you successfully
destroy every enemy, you will be given a wining screen. Every enemy requires one bullet to destroy, except for the boss, a blue rectangle that moves faster and will require
three bullets to destroy.

Additional things to note in the game are the speedup and slowdown squares, as well as the no shoot zone. The speedup square is initially on the bottom left, and is green. 
If the player comes in contact with the square, they will move faster, and the power up will jump to the bottom right, now a red square that returns the player to their 
normal speed. Along with this is the black zone that moves between the center and bottom right. This zone prevents the player from firing their bullet while they are inside.

Possible/Probable bugs in the game involve the extra space when the player is in the zone, caused by the erasure of previous player display. Addionally, there is an occasional
possibility of the win screen being displayed before all the enemies are defeated, however, does not occur often, and the requirements to reproduce this bug are not known
at this time.
